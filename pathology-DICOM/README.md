# Digital Pathology Viewer (Placeholder)

A minimal placeholder README for the Digital Pathology Viewer project. This repository contains a basic Expo-based frontend scaffold for viewing and exploring whole-slide images (WSI) and pathology-related data.

## Overview

- Lightweight viewer for whole-slide images with zoom, pan, and basic annotation support.
- Designed as a starting point for building clinical/research tools for digital pathology.

## Features (Planned)

- Multi-resolution tile-based image viewing (Deep Zoom / OpenSlide tiles)
- Smooth zoom & pan controls
- Layered annotations (points, polygons, labels)
- Image metadata and slide navigation
- Basic export/import of annotations

## Getting started (development)

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

3. Open the app in an emulator, simulator, or on-device via the Expo Dev Tools.

The app uses file-based routing; edit the files under the `app` directory to begin development.

## Project layout

- `app/` — Expo app entry and routes
- `assets/` — static images and assets

## Contributing & Next Steps

- Replace this placeholder with architecture notes, data format specs, and sample slides.
- Add CI checks, linting, and unit/integration tests for viewer functionality.
- Implement tile server integration, authentication, and storage for annotations.

## License

This project is currently a placeholder. Add a license file when you choose a license.

If you'd like, I can expand this README with developer setup details, architecture diagrams, or a contribution guide.
