# Digital Pathology Viewer 

A minimal example for a pathology/DICOM Viewer for react native/expo along with OHIF. 

## Getting started (development)

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

3. Open the app in an emulator, simulator, or on-device via the Expo Dev Tools.

The app uses file-based routing; edit the files under the `app` directory to begin development.

## Project layout

- `app/` — Expo app entry and routes
- `assets/` — static images and assets
